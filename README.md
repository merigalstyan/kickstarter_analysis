# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.


### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyse the kickstarter campaigns and uncover trends.
Louise wanted to use this data to uncover the best ways of making the "Fever" play successful. 

### Data Analysis

First of all, looking and analysing the data showed that a parent category theater had the most successful outcomes, which can only mean that a theater play Louise wants to put together has a high chance of being successful.

In addition, we can conclude that the US had both most failed and successful outcomes compared to other countries. Here are top 5 results:

# Outcomes based on Launch Day

Looking at the relation between the parent category "Theater" and the Launch Dates we can clearly see that most successful outcomes were around May. This observation can be very valuable for Louise's future plans.

# Goal and Pledged amounts

Comparing the goal and pledged amounts for the campaigns the analysis showed that successful campaigns had much lower goals than failed campaigns, which could be an indication that high expectations lead to failure.

However, based on the pledged amounts we can assume that the success didn't only depend on expected money.

I would recommend that Louise does appropriate and exact calculations regarding the goal set for the campaigns to avoid from asking too much. In addition, since the success rate is much higher in the US, especially in theater subcategory, Louise should direct her focus on this. Since the failed outcomes are also high in US than anywhere else, I would recommend collecting more data to analyse different reasons for failures.
